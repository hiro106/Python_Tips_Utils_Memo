## What I (hiro106) learned
### - which I didn't know, had forgotten, or had known but don't have a good command of.
- math is a module. A module is just a collection of variables (a namespace, if you like) defined by someone else. We can see all the names in math using the built-in function dir().
- We can also call help() on the module itself. This will give us the combined documentation for all the functions and values in the module (as well as a high-level description of the module). Click the "output" button to see the whole math help page.
